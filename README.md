- View all students with their average grades
- Calculate overall class averages
- View detailed reports for individual students
- Save and load gradebook data to/from files
- Handle errors gracefully to prevent crashes

The application demonstrates key Python programming concepts including user interaction, data structures, control flow, functions, and error handling.

FEATURES
--------
- Interactive menu-driven interface
- Data storage using Python dictionaries
- File I/O for persistent data storage
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Formatted output with tables and summaries
- Multiple custom functions for modular code organization

HOW TO RUN
----------
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system
2. Save the gradebook.py file to your computer
